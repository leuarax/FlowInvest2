# Email Verification Setup

## Overview

The FlowInvest application now requires email verification for all user accounts. This ensures that users provide valid email addresses and helps prevent spam accounts.

## How It Works

1. **Registration**: When a user registers, a verification email is automatically sent to their email address
2. **Email Verification**: Users must click the verification link in their email before they can access the application
3. **Login Protection**: Users cannot log in until their email is verified
4. **Resend Functionality**: Users can request a new verification email if needed

## User Flow

### New User Registration
1. User fills out registration form
2. Account is created and verification email is sent
3. User is redirected to email verification page
4. User clicks verification link in email
5. User can now log in and access the application

### Existing User Login
1. User attempts to log in
2. If email is not verified, they see an error message
3. User can request a new verification email
4. User clicks verification link in email
5. User can now log in successfully

## Firebase Configuration

### Enable Email Verification in Firebase Console

1. Go to your Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Authentication > Settings
3. In the "Authorized domains" section, make sure your domain is listed
4. Email verification is enabled by default for new Firebase projects

### Custom Email Templates (Optional)

You can customize the verification email template:

1. Go to Authentication > Templates
2. Click on "Verification email"
3. Customize the subject line and email content
4. You can include your app's branding and styling

## Components

### EmailVerification Component
- Located at `src/components/EmailVerification.js`
- Shows verification status and instructions
- Provides buttons to check verification status and resend emails
- Handles success and error states

### Updated AuthContext
- Added `emailVerified` state
- Added `checkEmailVerificationStatus()` function
- Added `resendVerificationEmailHandler()` function
- Updated sign-in process to check email verification

### Updated Routes
- Added `/verify-email` route
- Updated `ProtectedRoute` to redirect unverified users
- Added `EmailVerificationRoute` component

## Error Handling

The application handles various email verification scenarios:

- **Email not verified**: Shows specific error message and redirects to verification page
- **Verification email sent**: Shows success message
- **Resend failed**: Shows error message with retry option
- **Network errors**: Graceful fallback with user-friendly messages

## Testing

### Test Email Verification Flow

1. Register a new account with a valid email
2. Check that you're redirected to the verification page
3. Check your email for the verification link
4. Click the verification link
5. Try logging in - should work now

### Test Error Scenarios

1. Try logging in with an unverified account
2. Test the "Resend Verification Email" button
3. Test the "I've Verified My Email" button
4. Check that error messages are displayed properly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Verification emails not received**
   - Check spam folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Check Firebase console for any errors

2. **Verification link not working**
   - Make sure the link is clicked in the same browser
   - Check if the link has expired (usually 24 hours)
   - Try requesting a new verification email

3. **Users stuck on verification page**
   - Check if email verification status is being updated correctly
   - Verify Firebase configuration
   - Check browser console for errors

### Firebase Console Monitoring

Monitor the following in Firebase Console:
- Authentication > Users: Check user verification status
- Authentication > Sign-in method: Verify email/password is enabled
- Functions > Logs: Check for any verification-related errors

## Security Considerations

- Email verification helps prevent spam accounts
- Verification links expire after 24 hours by default
- Users cannot access protected routes without verification
- Failed verification attempts are logged for monitoring

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Email verification reminder emails
- Custom verification email templates
- SMS verification as an alternative
- Two-factor authentication after email verification
